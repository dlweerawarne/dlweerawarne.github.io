                <h2 id="printing-flexible-electronics-with-office-inkjet-printers">Printing flexible electronics with Office Inkjet Printers</h2>
<p>Rapid prototyping is a critical aspect of product development, enabling quick iteration and evaluation of design concepts. Traditional methods for fabricating IDEs involve complex and expensive processes, such as photolithography and etching. By harnessing the capabilities of office inkjet printers, we aim to provide an alternative approach that is not only affordable but also allows for rapid iteration and customization. In this research, we focus on investigating the printability and performance of different inkjet-printed materials, such as conductive inks, on flexible substrates. We evaluate the compatibility of various inkjet printers with different types of conductive inks, exploring their resolution, conductivity, adhesion, and durability. Our goal is to identify the most suitable inkjet-printed materials and printer configurations for producing high-quality flexible IDEs.</p>

<h2 id="graphene-conductive-inks-for-flexible-electronics">Graphene conductive inks for flexible electronics</h2>
<p>Graphene, a two-dimensional material consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms, possesses exceptional electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, and flexibility. These unique characteristics make it an ideal candidate for the development of next-generation flexible electronics, such as wearable sensors, bendable displays, and smart textiles. Our research focuses on the synthesis of graphene-based conductive inks, which are essential components for printing flexible electronic circuits. By utilizing locally sourced mineral resources as a starting point, we aim to develop a sustainable and cost-effective approach for large-scale production of graphene-based inks.</p>

<h2 id="quality-control-of-precision-dispensing">Quality control of precision dispensing</h2>
<p>Flexible electronics have emerged as a promising technology, offering numerous applications such as wearable devices, flexible displays, and healthcare sensors. One crucial aspect in the fabrication of these devices is the precise deposition of conductive thick pastes onto flexible substrates. This process requires careful control to ensure accurate placement and reliable electrical performance. Our research focuses on developing innovative techniques and methodologies for quality control in the dispensing process. By leveraging our expertise in materials science, engineering, and metrology, we aim to overcome challenges associated with the fabrication of flexible electronics</p>
